# üß≠ Basic Tab Bar Controller - Hackathon Starter Project

<img src="Assets/BasicTabBarControllerDemo.gif" alt="Basic Tab Bar Controller Demo" width="500"/>

> TL;DR Use tabs to navigate your app.  Have a hackthon idea? Fork this and build something cool!

This project was inspired by a few hackathon designs I've seen this year while mentoring for [Cal Hacks](https://calhacks.io/).  The tab bar design pattern is used to quickly navigate between controllers.

## Interactions
* **Tap the tabs** - *Navigate Away* üöÄ

## Getting Started

1. ‚úÖ  Fork the Project
2. ‚úÖ  Build + Run 
3. ‚úÖ  Tap!

## Try it Yourself

Update any of these `FirstViewController`, `SecondViewController`, or `ThirdViewController` and add more than just a different background color.

```swift
class FirstViewController: UIViewController {
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // TODO: Programmatic add whatever, views, tables, collections, blah
    }
    
}


```
