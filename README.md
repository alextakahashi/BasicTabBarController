# ðŸ§­ Basic Tab Bar Controller - Hackathon Starter Project

<img src="Assets/BasicTabBarControllerDemo.gif" alt="Basic Tab Bar Controller Demo" width="500"/>

> TL;DR Use tabs to navigate your app.  Have a hackthon idea? Fork this and build something cool!

This project was inspired by a few hackathon designs I've seen this year while mentoring for [Cal Hacks](https://calhacks.io/).  The tab bar design pattern is used to quickly navigate between controllers.

## Interactions
